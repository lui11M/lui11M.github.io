            <div class="text-columns">
                <p>The era of Estado Novo (New State) stands as a poignant testament to the intricacies of power and
                    governance and their
                    restrictions. Portugal bore witness to a regime characterised by authoritarianism and censorship,
                    where gatherings of
                    more than three people were deemed subversive acts, a facet that shaped the society and dynamics of
                    socialising. This
                    decree, aimed at stifling dissent and maintaining control, imposed a stark reality upon the
                    populace.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In honour of the 50th birthday of the 25th of April, also known as the Carnation Revolution which put
                    an end to the
                    dictatorship regime in Portugal , my amazing team and I delve into the ridiculous forbidden rules of
                    the Estado Novo
                    (such as the prohibition gatherings of more that three people, kissing in public or even drinking
                    Coca-Cola ) through
                    the creation of a 3D animation, were our narratives will explore these prohibition, and the nations
                    resistance and angst
                    to this enforced limitations. This animation would then be videomapped in one of the oldest schools
                    in Lisbon.</p>

                <p>In parallel to this project, my group and I (which consisted of a collaboration between Global Design
                    Bachelors and the
                    Creative Tech Bachelors), had to have an interactive experience which contextualised the audience in
                    regards to our
                    project and had to create a brand/studio. Therefore we created Porque Sim Studios (in english it
                    translates to Because
                    Studios), our logo and brand identity can be found throughout our project.</p>
